# ardorClientJs
JavaScript client for interacting with the Ardor Blockchain.

It is heavily inspired by these two repositories:
- [ardorjs](https://github.com/mrv777/ardorjs) created by [mrv777](https://github.com/mrv777)
- [ardor-promises](https://github.com/malnemark/ardor-promises) created by [malnemark](https://github.com/malnemark)

basically it's a merge of these two repositories with additional features like passphrase creation, token and account property handling
